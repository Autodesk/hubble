<h3>Tokenless Authentication Requests</h3>

<p>
If your GitHub Enterprise appliance is configured to use <a href="https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.11/admin/guides/user-management/using-ldap/">LDAP for authentication</a>,
then every request against GitHub requires an additional
request against LDAP. At best, this will delay the GitHub request because
GitHub needs to wait for the LDAP request first. At worst, the GitHub request
will fail if the LDAP request fails (e.g. because the LDAP server is overloaded with requests).
To avoid these problems users should use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/">Personal Access Tokens (HTTPS)</a>
or <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/">SSH keys</a>
to authenticate. GitHub can check those without an additional request.
