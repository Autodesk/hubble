<h3>Operations</h3>
<div class="chart-container">
	<canvas
		class="chart"
		data-url="{{ site.dataURL }}/git-download.tsv"

			"series": [
				"Clones/Day",
				"Fetches/Day"
			]
		}'

</div>
<p>
	Cloning a Git repository is expensive as the entire repository history
	must be transfered. Clients that have cloned a repository before should
	rather fetch the latest changes. This is (sometimes dramatically!)
	faster for the client and less expensive for the server. A high number
	of clone operations usually indicate an unfavorable configured CI process.

<h3>Transferred Data</h3>
<div class="chart-container">
	<canvas
		class="chart"
		data-url="{{ site.dataURL }}/git-download.tsv"
		data-type="history"
		data-config='{
			"series": [
				"Clone Traffic GB/Day",
				"Fetch Traffic GB/Day"
			]
		}'
	></canvas>
</div>
<p>
	Visualizes the amount of data transferred for clones and fetches.
	To save resources you should try to minimize the number of clones,
	especially for large repositories. The table below lists the
	repositories that accounted for the majority of traffic yesterday.
