			The percentage of active repositories located in organizations with at least one active <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/">protected branch</a> and at least one <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-topics/">topic</a> assigned to them.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this context, <em>active</em> designates repositories with at least one pushed commit in the last four weeks.
		</p>
		<p>
			All shared branches (for example, master and release branches) should be protected to ensure that they cannot be deleted or rewritten by accident.
			Furthermore, tagging repository with associated topics increases their discoverability.
