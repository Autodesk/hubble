			<em>Vulnerable</em> indicates that a Git client is affected by a publicly disclosed vulnerability.
			In this chart, affected Git versions are counted as vulnerable <em>after</em> the date the security issue was made public.
			On and before that date, the Git version is not considered as vulnerable (the reasoning being that the vulnerability was not publicly known and hopefully not yet actively exploited).
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Outdated</em> means that a Git version was superseded by a newer patch release (though no vulnerabilities were publicly reported).
			We don’t recommend using Git versions that are not at the latest patch level.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Recommended</em> Git versions are the latest patch-level releases for which no vulnerabilities were reported before a specific date.
