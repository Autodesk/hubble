				<i>Using license</i> shows you how many GitHub Enterprise licenses you  use on a given day.
				<i>Pushing commits</i> shows you how many different people pushed commits to your appliance in the last month/week/day.
				The gap to <i>using license</i> indicates the amount of people that have either not logged in or that have not pushed code (e.g. people that only read/comment code).
