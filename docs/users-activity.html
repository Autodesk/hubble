<p>
	<i>Using license</i> shows you how many GitHub Enterprise licenses you
	use on a given day. <i>Pushing commits</i> shows you how many different
	people pushed commits to your appliance in the last month/week/day.
	The gap to <i>using license</i> indicates the amount of people that
	have either not logged in or that have not pushed code (e.g. people
	that only read/comment code).
