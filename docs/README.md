## Hubble Web Application

This web application is built as a [Jekyll]() site and is intended to be hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Overview

Each `.html` page in this directory contains one or more charts. Each chart is defined as an `<svg>` element a few special attributes that define their behaviour:

1. a `data-url` attribute referencing a `.tsv` file generated by the [updater component](../updater/README.md) - this is a relative URL that directs the chart where to ask for data from.
1. a `class` attribute defining the kind of chart that will be rendered. Acceptable values are `chart`, `table`, and `collaboration`.
1. a `data-type` attribute referencing the sub-type of chart that will be rendered. Acceptable values are `history` and `list`.

For details on how each kind of chart is rendered, take a look at the [`charts.js` file](assets/js/charts.js).

## Development

To run the site locally, you will need to install [Jekyll](). Then change the `_config.yml` file and set the `dataURL` to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/demo-data`. Finally, run `jekyll serve`,
and load http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser.
