## Hubble Web Application

This web application is built as a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site and is intended to be hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Overview

### Charts

Each `.html` page in this directory contains one or more charts. Each chart is defined as an `<svg>` element with a few special attributes that define their behaviour:

1. a `data-url` attribute referencing a `.tsv` file generated by the [updater component](../updater/README.md) - this is a relative URL that directs the chart where to ask for data from.
1. a `class` attribute defining the kind of chart that will be rendered. Acceptable values are `chart`, `table`, and `collaboration`.
1. a `data-type` _only applicable if the `class` is set to `chart`_; attribute referencing the sub-type of chart that will be rendered. Acceptable values are `history` and `list`.

For details on how each kind of chart is rendered, take a look at the [`charts.js` file](assets/js/charts.js).

## Development

To run the site locally, you will need to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Then change the `_config.yml` file and set the `dataURL` to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/demo-data`. Finally, run `jekyll serve`,
and load http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser.

## Tests

This web application uses a framework called [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) as a test runner (a way to run JavaScript in different browser contexts), and [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io)
as the testing / assertion library. The tests are implemented as `.js` files under the `spec/` folder, and as much as possible mirror the filenames of JavaScript source files.

### Requirements

- You will need a recent version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.
- The tests run in a headless instance of the **Google Chrome** browser, so you will need a recent version of Google Chrome installed.
- Install any needed dependencies by running `npm install` from this folder.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests once:

    $ npm test

During local development, it may be nice to keep the test runner running in the background as one makes changes to the JavaScript source files (under `assets/js/`), or the test files (under `spec/`) so as to
get immediate feedback. This mode will re-run the tests every time a source or test file changes. To run in this mode:

    $ npm test -- --no-single-run --auto-watch
