## Hubble Enterprise Web Dashboard

This web application is built as a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site and is intended to be hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Charts

Each `.html` page in this directory contains one or more charts.
Charts are dynamically created by [`charts.js`](assets/js/charts.js) from `<div class="chart-placeholder">` placeholders.

#### Structure

Charts generally have the following structure:

```html
<div class="chart-placeholder">
	<h3>Title</h3>
	<canvas
		data-url="{{ site.dataURL }}/chart-data.tsv"
		data-type="history"
		data-config='{...}'
		></canvas>
	<div class="info-box">
		<p>
			Description of the chart.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
```

- `<h3>`: the title of the chart (required)
- `<canvas>`: used to configure regular charts; change the tag to `<table>` for tables and `<svg>` for chord charts
  - `data-url`: the URL to the `.tsv` file that shall be rendered by the chart (generated by the [updater](../updater/README.md))
  - `data-type`: the chart type, supported types are:
    - `history`: time series charts for tracking metrics over time
    - `list`: horizontal bar charts for general numeric data
    - `table`: tables directly rendered from the TSV source
    - `chord`: chord diagrams used to visualize connections between entities
  - `data-config`: chart-type-specific configuration options (see [option list below](#configuration-options))
- `<div class="info-box">`: zero or more info boxes with descriptive texts

For details on how each kind of chart is rendered, take a look at [`charts.js`](assets/js/charts.js).

#### Configuration Options

##### History Charts

| option | values | description |
|---|---|---|
| `series` | array of strings | only include these data series and drop all others (referenced by TSV table headings) |
| `visibleSeries` | array of strings | only show the listed data series and hide all others initially (referenced by TSV table headings) |
| `slice` | array `[t0, t1]` | slice the data from the TSV file as if `data.slice(t0, t1)` was called |
| `aggregate` | dictionary (see below) | defines how data should be aggregated (default: `undefined`, which leaves the data untouched) |
| `aggregate.period` | `week`, `month` | specifies the range over which the data shall be aggregated |
| `aggregate.method` | `sum`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, `first`, `last`, `median` | specifies the aggregation method; `first` and `last` select the chronologically first or last data point present in each period, respectively |
| `showRawDataLink` | `true`, `false` | show the link to download the chartâ€™s raw data (default: `true`) |

##### List Charts

| option | values | description |
|---|---|---|
| `stacked` | `true`, `false` | render the data series as stacked bars instead of showing multiple bars per row |

### Development

To run the site locally, install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
Then, change the `_config.yml` file and set the `dataURL` to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/demo-data`.
Finally, run `jekyll serve` and load `http://127.0.0.1:4000` in your browser.

#### Tests

This web application uses [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) as a test runner (a way to run JavaScript in different browser contexts) and [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io) as the testing and assertion library.
The tests are implemented as `.js` files inside the [`spec/`](spec/) folder and mirror the filenames of JavaScript source files.

#### Requirements

- Install a recent version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- Install a recent version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), a headless instance of which is used to run the tests.
- Install any needed dependencies by running `npm install` from this folder.

#### Running the Tests

To run the tests and linter:

```sh
npm test
```

To run just the unit tests once:

```sh
npm run unit-test
```

During local development, it may be nice to keep the test runner running in the background as one makes changes to the JavaScript source files (under [`assets/js/`](assets/js)) or the test files (under [`spec/`](spec/)) so as to get immediate feedback.
This mode will rerun the tests every time a source or test file changes.
To run in this mode:

```sh
npm run unit-test -- --no-single-run --auto-watch
```

#### Linting JavaScript

This project has formalized a JavaScript style using [ESLint](https://eslint.org).
To run the linter, ensure you have dependencies installed via `npm install`, then run:

```sh
npm run lint
```

ESLint allows for [cascading rules](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuration-cascading-and-hierarchy) to be in place, which this project leverages:

- There is one global ESLint config defined in [`.eslintrc.json`](.eslintrc.json), where we house the main stylistic rules.
- We also have a browser-context-specific config defined in [`assets/js/.eslintrc.json`](assets/js/.eslintrc.json).
- Finally, we have a test-context-specific config defined in [`spec/.eslintrc.json`](spec/.eslintrc.json).

[`.eslintignore`](.eslintignore) defines what directories and files should not be linted.
