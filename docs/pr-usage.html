	Visualizes the percentage of active repositories, located in organizations,
	having more than one contributor, that use pull requests for contributions.
	"Active" means repositories with at least two pushes in the last 4 weeks.
	High pull request usage can indicate a high number of code reviews. In
	addition the percentage of status usage in these pull requests is visualized.
	High status usage can indicate a high usage of CI.
</p>
<p>
	Repositories in personal accounts and repositories with a single contributor
	are ignored as pull request usage is less likely for them.
