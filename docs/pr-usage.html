			The percentage of active repositories located in organizations, having more than one contributor, and using pull requests for contributions.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this context, <em>active</em> designates repositories with at least two users that have pushed commits in the last four weeks.
			The rationale behind this is that pull request usage is most important in a collaborative environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			High pull request usage might indicate a high number of code reviews.
