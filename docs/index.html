			The top 50&nbsp;connections between organizations over the last two years.

			A connection between two organizations is rated higher the more people contribute to both organizations.
			Users are considered <em>members</em> of an organization if the majority of their pushes were made to this organization.

			The depicted collaboration is especially meaningful if the affected organizations cover different topics.
			If two organizations cover the same topic (for example, an organization <em>foo-server</em> and an organization <em>foo-client</em>), then the collaboration is less meaningful.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this situation, it might be a good idea to consolidate the two organizations into one (in this example, <em>foo</em>).
