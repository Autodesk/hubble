<p>Visualize the top 50 connections between organizations over the last two
years. A connection between two organizations is rated higher if more people
contribute to both organizations. A user is considered a "member" of an
organization if the user made the most pushes to this organization.
The depicted collaboration is especially meaningful if the affected
organizations cover different topics. If two organizations cover the same topic
(e.g. an organization "foo-server" and an organization "foo-client"), then the
collaboration is less meaningful. In this situation it might be a good idea to
consolidate the two organizations into one (e.g. "foo").
