<p>Visualize the organizations with the largest number of people contributing
to other organizations. The depicted collaboration is especially meaningful if
the affected organizations cover different topics. If two organizations cover
the same topic (e.g. an organization "foo-server" and an organization
"foo-client"), then the collaboration is less meaningful. In this situation it
might be a good idea to consolidate the two organizations into one (e.g. "foo").</p>
