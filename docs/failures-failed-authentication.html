			Looking at failed authentication attempts across the system is helpful in spotting misconfigured systems that may be tying up authentication workers.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, users may have changed credentials used to access GitHub, however they failed to update CI/CD systems using those credentials. Another example is that a CI/CD system
			may be configured with a user account which is no longer active in GitHub and/or your company.
		</p>

			Therefore, you should try to reduce them.
