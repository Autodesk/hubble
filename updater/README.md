## Hubble Enterprise Updater

The updater may be run in two modes:

1. As a [service on a dedicated machine](README.md#setup-on-a-dedicated-machine) that calls the GitHub Enterprise appliance.
	* Pro: No modification to the GitHub Enterprise image necessary.
	* Con: Requires an additional machine and [administrative shell access](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.11/admin/guides/installation/administrative-shell-ssh-access/).
1. As a [service on the GitHub Enterprise appliance](README.md#setup-on-the-github-enterprise-appliance).
	* Pro: Quick and easy setup. No additional machine required.
	* Con: Requires modifications to the GitHub Enterprise image.
	* Con: Will need to reinstall the service after each upgrade of your GitHub Enterprise appliance.

### Setup on a Dedicated Machine

1. Set up a Linux or macOS machine.
1. Ensure that Git and Python 3 are installed (for instance, on macOS via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with `brew update && brew install python3`).
1. Clone this repository to your machine.
1. Create a config file in `updater/config.py` in your local clone (based on [`updater/config.py.example`](config.py.example))
1. Configure a service or cronjob that executes `python3 update-stats.py` once per day.

Alternatively, you can set it up via Docker:
1. Build the Docker image
    ```sh
    $ docker build . --tag hubble-updater
    ```
1. Create a config file in `updater/config.py` (based on [`updater/config.py.example`](config.py.example))
1. Configure a service or cron job that executes the Docker container once a day (replace `/path/to/config.py` and `/path/to/key` with your paths):
    ```sh
    docker run -it --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/config.py,target=/hubble-updater/config.py --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/key,target=/key hubble-updater
    ```
 
### Setup on the GitHub Enterprise Appliance

#### Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Autodesk/hubble/releases/latest) from GitHub.
1. Check the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded package against the value published on the release page:
	```sh
	sha256sum hubble-enterprise_x.y.z_all.deb
	```
1. Install the package:
	```sh
	sudo dpkg -i hubble-enterprise_x.y.z_all.deb
	```
1. Create a config file in `/opt/autodesk/hubble-enterprise/config.py` (based on `[config.py.example](config.py.example)`).
1. Enable and start the **periodic** updater process (persistently, survives reboots):
	```sh
	sudo systemctl enable hubble-enterprise.timer
	sudo systemctl start hubble-enterprise.timer
	```
1. Optionally, you may **trigger** the updater process (just once):
	```sh
	sudo systemctl start hubble-enterprise.service
	```

#### Upgrading

1. Remove old versions of the package (if existent):
	```sh
	sudo apt-get remove hubble-enterprise
	```
1. Install the new version of the package:
	```sh
	sudo dpkg -i hubble-enterprise_x.y.z_all.deb
	```
1. If the `systemd` files (the service or timer file) have changed, let systemd adapt to the changes:
	```sh
	sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
	```

#### Uninstallation

1. Disable the **periodic** updater process:
	```sh
	sudo systemctl disable hubble-enterprise.timer
	```
1. Remove the package:
	```sh
	sudo apt-get remove hubble-enterprise
	```

#### Debugging

The updaterâ€™s log is accessible as follows:
```sh
journalctl -fu hubble-enterprise.service
```
