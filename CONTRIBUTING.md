## Contributing to Hubble Enterprise

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your
help is essential for keeping it great.

## Branching strategy

In general, contributors should develop on branches based off of `master` 
and pull requests should be to `master`.

## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork](https://github.com/Autodesk/hubble/fork) and clone the repository
1. Create a new branch based on `master`: `git checkout -b <my-branch-name> master`
1. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass (as soon as we have a testing framework ;-)
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/Autodesk/hubble/compare) from your branch to `master`
1. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

* Follow the existing style where possible.
* Write tests.
* Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you
would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting
them as separate pull requests.
* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
