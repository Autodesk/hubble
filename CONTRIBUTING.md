## Contributing to Hubble Enterprise

Hi there!
We’re thrilled that you’d like to contribute to this project.
Your help is essential for keeping this project great and for making it better.

## Branching Strategy

In general, contributors should develop on branches based off of `master` and pull requests should be made against `master`.

## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork](https://github.com/Autodesk/hubble/fork) and clone the repository.
1. Create a new branch based on `master`: `git checkout -b <my-branch-name> master`.
1. Make your changes, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass.
  - Changes to the web app (i.e. anything under `docs/`) can be validated by [running the web app tests](docs/README.md#tests).
  - Changes to the updater component (i.e. anything under `updater/`) can't be validated yet, since we need a test suite there :).
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/Autodesk/hubble/compare) from your branch to `master`.
1. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request to be accepted:

- Follow the existing style where possible.
- Write tests.
- Keep your change as focused as possible.
  If you want to make multiple independent changes, please consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
